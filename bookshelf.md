__Reading Currently:__

- Donald Knuth: _The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 1_ (probably never to be finished)
- Brett Slatkin: _Effective Python: 59 Specific Ways to Write Better_ 
- A bunch of RFC papers

-----------------------


__Things I've Read__:

- _MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters_
: google whitepaper on the high level algorithm of how their map reduce algorithm works, along with use cases, challenges with real world deployment, and performance of different versions

- Sam Newman: _Building Microservices_
: architecture of microservices

- Humble and Farley: _Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases..._
: a dry book which relentlessly provides contradictory advice and practices. There is wisdom in this book, but you have to understand when and where to apply them. Be careful of overengineered solutions.

- Tom DeMarco: _Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams_
: interesting perspective from management point of view

- Adam Webber: _Modern Programming Languages: A Practical Introduction_
: actually a solid book providing introduction to important language concepts.
